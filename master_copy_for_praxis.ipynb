You can run code in this interactive environment which is interspersed with textual commentary. You can also edit the code and write new code. Google Collab provides a user-friendly environment to practice coding.\n",

        "<p>Excellent! What we did here is simply to create variables called \"first_number\" and \"second_number\" and then to store certain data in them (the numbers 5 and 7). Then we created a new variable called \"sum\" and told the computer that we want to store the sum of those first two variables in that third variable. Finally, we asked the computer to print or display whatever is stored in that third variable called \"sum\" along with some text \"the sum of these numbers is \" in the display space. That's it! That's all there is to computer programming! If you understand how to use this basic syntax to tell your computer how to store things and how you want to create complex relationships between those stored things, you can do amazing and powerful things. Everything we use on a computer, including social media, netflix, games, sending rockets to the moon etc. — everything has been built using these rudimentary building blocks. Its all about building more and more complexity to this basic structure. Amazing isn't it? </p>"

        "<b> 2.2: Close reading (micro-analysis) [microscope]:  </b> \"close reading is the thorough interpretation of a text passage by the determination of central themes and the analysis of their development. Moreover, close reading includes the analysis of (1) individuals, events, and ideas, their development and interaction, (2) used words and phrases, (3) text structure and style, and (4) argument patterns\" (Janicke et al. 2015)\n",
        "    \n",

This can be especially useful in discourse anlaysis when we are trying to find out how certain words or concepts are understood within a text, or within a corpus of texts that represent a particular socio-historical or cultural moment. For example, if we look at a global news corpus, the word \"states\" would appear as an important collocate of the word \"united\", because the word \"united states\" would appear quite frequently in it."

        "2) Example 2: Thomas and Droge (2022) analyse a huge corpus of newspapers in the US to see what kind of topics are commonly used whenever the word \"Humanities\" is referred to. They use a Machine Learning technique called topic modelling which is like a fancier version of collocates analysis. They find that instead of Humanities bein referred to only in terms of \"crisis\", which is what academics believe is the public discourse around this discipline, there are a range of interesting topics that are prevalent. Let's explore their findings here: https://we1s.ucsb.edu/research/we1s-findings/key-findings/"
